## Introduction

The Sunbird Mobile app provides mobility to the feature rich learning platform. It provides learners with the flexibility to learn anywhere, anytime and even without an Internet connection. 

## Prerequisites

To set up Sunbird mobile app, ensure you have installed the following:

* NPM Version - 3.5.2
* Node JS Version - above 6
* Cordova Version - 8.0.0
* Ionic Version - 3.20.0

## Build APK from Git Repository
Sunbird mobile app can be built from the main source code which lies at [project-sunbird](https://github.com/project-sunbird)/[sunbird-mobile](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-mobile).

Sample properties file is kept inside buildConfig folder. This has to be renamed to sunbird.properties and appropriate avalues should be provided.

**app_id**

Unique identifier for the app
	
**app_name**

Name of the application

## Changing API Configuration

**app_version_code**
	
Version code for the app release.

To customize the end points in the app:

Replace redirect base url REDIRECT_BASE_URL and all other base urls with your respective domain name in sunbird.properties

**API Key:**

   Replace `release_fabric_api_key` in `sunbird.properties` with your fabric API Key. Please create an account in [fabric.io](https://get.fabric.io/) and register the app to get the API key.

**Secret:**

Generate the key and secret for mobile_app user using the JWT token of the mobile_admin user. The JWT token for mobile_admin user will be printed on the application

* **server folder /where-you-cloned-sunbird-devops-repo/sunbird-devops/deploy/logs/apis.log.*


Execute the listed API to generate the key and secret for the mobile app:

  curl -X POST \   <your-sunbird-base-url>/api/api-manager/v1/consumer/mobile_app/credential/register \
       -H 'authorization: Bearer <mobile_admin_jwt_token_from_apis_log_file>' \
       -H 'content-type: application/json' \
       -d '{
       "request": {
         "key": "<implementation-name>-mobile-app-<version-number>"
       }
     }'

Response body: 

{"result":{"key":"<implementation-name>-mobile-app-<version-number>","secret":"<secret>"}} 

Use the value of "key" and "secret" from the response above for MOBILE_APP_KEY and MOBILE_APP_SECRET configuration in respective environments in gradle.properties file. Example:

**dev_mobile_app_key = "<implementation-name>-mobile-app-<version-number>"
dev_mobile_app_secret = "<secret>"**

**Producer Key**

Replace the producer id PRODUCER_ID for respective environments in sunbird.properties 

Like "dev.sunbird.app".

**Fabric credentials:**

Replace `release_fabric_api_key` in `sunbird.properties` with your fabric API Key. Please create an account in [fabric.io](https://get.fabric.io/) and register the app to get the API key.

### Changing Deep link schema

This plugin handles deeplinks on iOS and Android for both custom URL scheme links and Universal App Links. We can change the Deep link schema from sunbird.properties.

     App properties (app_id, app_name and app_version_code), Dev properties(dev_base_url= [https://dev.open-sunbird.org](https://dev.open-sunbird.org)) , Febric Keys , Secret code are sunbird properties used for  build the sunbird app.
